# Travel

The world is made up of destinations connected by trails. To go to a destination, it must have a trail to it. Your caravan cannot travel without a trail. Trails were created by adventurers before you under the protection of a crystal chalice as they flattened the ground for caravans.

## Leaving the trail

If you leave the trail, abandon your caravan and treat it as if you were exploring a dungeon.

## Other Crystal Caravans

You are not the only crystal caravan out there. You'll find other caravans on their own travels. Seeking myrrh dews just like you. Trading resources between towns. Exploring the word. Many caravans are friendly. They'll offer to trade with you, share knowledge, or involve you in their story. You'll meet them when you're on the trails between destinations.

## Mana Streams

The world is split by rivers of pure mana that reject anything that gets close to it. Crystal Caravans may pass through them if their Chalice is attuned to the same element.
