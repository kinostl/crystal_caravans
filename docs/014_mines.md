# The Mine of Cathiurges

> When the grandfather of my grandfather's grandfather was still a child, no one in this land could challenge the might of the Lilties.
>
> They forged weapons of iron to bring the world under their dominion.
>
> But eventually the mine was exhausted, and the Liltie's unstoppable conquest ground to a halt.
>
> The Lilties' ambition vanished along with the iron. They abandoned the mine, where monsters now thrive.
