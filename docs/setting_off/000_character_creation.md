# Making your character

You and your party all come from the same town, and you are united on your quest to acquire Myrrh Dew for the continuation of that town.

Before you think of who you are, you should name this town and come up with some details about it. It'll help inform your characters and their families.

Whats it like? Are you a fishing village on a major trade route? Maybe a borough of a well defended city? A little town in a deep part of a mountain thats easily forgotten?

How is your town doing? Is it well equipped to handle the miasma, or is it struggling on its last year?

Anything beyond this might be a bit too much to consider, you won't be spending too much time there, but you will be keeping it in your memories as you travel. Its what you put your life at risk to defend.

## Who you can be

<!-- TODO Consider changing this to have Tribe be aesthetic and instead mechanically focus on Focus Stat -->
<!-- TODO Rewrite the tribe descriptions to focus on their society instead of typecasting everyone -->

You can choose from four tribes. Some equipment is tribe specific.

Your tribe comes with all listed benefits.

### The Clavats

!!! Info inline end "Clavat Benefits"

    - 1 Extra Dice when rolling Unity
    - Redirect damage to yourself, up to your Unity stat.

A gentle people that value harmony above all.

Many of Tipa's residents belong to this tribe of unity and friendship. They are gentle by nature and dislike conflict. When disputes arise, they do whatever they can to resolve them. It is said that an air of tranquility follows them wherever they go.

### The Lilties

!!! Info inline end "Liltie Benefits"

    - 1 Extra Dice when rolling Combat

    Lilties only have one benefit as they have more powerful weapons and better access to hearts.

A proud warrior tribe with infamously short tempers.

These little warriors have lived all over the world since ancient times. Long ago, they ruled the world, and many still believe themselves superior to others. Though they can be hotheaded, they are also confident and down-to-earth. Liltian merchants are some of the best around.

### The Yukes

!!! Info inline end "Yuke Benefits"

    - 1 Extra Dice when rolling Magic
    - Start dungeons with a random magicite

A mysterious tribe of great lore and wisdom.

Many of these sages live quietly in Shella. In the ancient wars, they were able to resist the invading Liltian armies thanks to their magical prowess. Now they spend their days teaching magic to others. Some say that Yukes assumed their current form to augment their magical talents. They are a mysterious people indeed.

### The Selkies

!!! Info inline end "Selkie Benefits"

    - 1 Extra Dice when rolling Luck
    - Rolling a 1 also counts as a crit
    - Ignore the first Underclock roll on each node

    Luck should rarely be rolled, so Selkies get an extra benefit.

Independent people who put themselves first.

These rugged individualists clothe themselves in fur decorated with stolen goods. Unlike other tribes, they believe in putting themselves first. Many Selkies are agile and athletic, traits they put to good use as thieves. Though the other tribes tend to scorn them, some Selkies now reside in Clavatian villages.

## Attributes

You have these Attributes. Distribute 2,2, and 3 across Combat, Magic, and Unity. Higher is better. Luck starts at 1.

-   **Yuke** you have 6 Hearts for every point of Magic.
-   **Selkie** you have 6 Hearts for every point of Luck.

## Reallocating Stats

During extensive downtime you can reallocate your attributes, setting the 2,2, and 3 as you did during character generation. You should have enough down time to flavor this appropriately if you elect to do this. Going to a school, working with a trainer, etc. The 3 represents your focus and specialization.

!!! Info "About Leveling Up"

    In most tabletop games you are able to level up. This system does not have the concept of levels. Instead you will be provided abilites, treasures, and artifacts that all modify your attributes.
