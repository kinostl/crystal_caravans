## How to Do Stuff

When you do something that has a risk to it, roll 3d6. Every dice resulting in a value less than or equal to the appropriate stat is a success. Dice that are equal to the appropriate stat exactly are Crits.

During a mission you may choose to roll 2d6 instead of 3d6. If you choose to do this you gain an additional treasure at the end of the mission regardless of the result. If you fail a risky roll, the miasma thickens.

## Going through a Mission

<!--TODO This section is messy. Clean it up. -->

Your mission has one goal: Get a drop of dew from a Myrrh tree in the depths of places where no one dare go. Dungeons and forests and forgotten places filled with monsters and their conniving traps.

The Miasma is a living thing that does not want you to do this. It is threatened by Myrrh. It cannot get close to a Myrrh tree to destory it, so it sets up defenses around it in the form of Monsters. They can enter warded places that Miasma can't, and they can harm in ways it cannot. Just like the Miasma, they want you dead. These defenses where Miasma and Myrrh conflict are known as Dungeons.

A Dungeon is made up of Nodes. Encounters that are either fighting, exploring, or puzzle solving. You won't know what a node is before entering it, but you will know the layout of a dungeon if you've been there before or if there are well made maps of it. Nodes change their type every time you enter the dungeon.

When you finish a node, the GM will secretly roll 1d6 for each exit to see what kind of node it leads to. This is so you can try to get hints about whats in each node before approaching it. Asking for hints acts the same as a Puzzle node.

1. Fight
2. Explore
3. Trap
4. Fight w/ Treasure
5. Explore w/ Moogle Nest
6. Trap w/ Treasure

### The Miasma

<!--TODO Talk about The Miasma's relationship to Monsters here, then detail in the monsters section. -->

<!-- Reference: -->
<!-- https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2023/04/the-underclock-fixing-random-encounter.html -->

The Miasma does not want your mission to succeed and will fight you the entire time. Its pressure starts at 0. When the miasma thickens, add 1d6 to its pressure.

When the miasma's pressure is above...

-   6, monsters will no longer be surprised by you.
-   12, the party becomes and stays nausesous.
-   18, the party becomes poisoned and loses 1 heart every time they roll.
-   24, consider the mission faied. Abandon the dungeon and return to town.

#### What makes it thicken?

This list is not exhaustive

-   Some monsters may roll to thicken the miasma instead of attaking.
-   Taking too many actions while exploring or solving puzzles thickens the miasma.

## Equipment

Your character has 5 Equipment Slots - Weapon, Armor, and two Accessory Slots. Trying to wear or carry more than this will overwhelm your character.

You may put Food into your accessory slots. Eating it will free up the accessory slot.

Magicite that isn't fused to a weapon takes up an accessory slot.
