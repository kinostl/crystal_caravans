# Mushroom Forest

> When I was a child, I once asked my mother, "Where did I come from?"
>
> She answered, "Why, we all sprouted from the Mushroom Forest, of course."
>
> Nightmares soon haunted my sleep. I dreamt that I was long among the toadstools.
>
> I awoke in tears, but felt the warmth of my mother's embrace as she comforted me. It is something I still remember to this day.
