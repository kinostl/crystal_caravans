# Example of Gameplay

A Caravan of 4 Characters from the town of Tipa are going to the River Belle Path to defeat the Giant Crab and get their first drop of Myrhh Dew. They will ask around town for advice, and prepare themselves for the adventure. This will involve optimizing their inventories, and making use of the resources the town can provide. Advice, materials, weapons, anything they can spare that pushes the odds into their favors.

## Sending Off Day

The story starts with the town's celebration of its crystal caravan starting its adventure. Food, joyous activities, and a general air of hospitality. Its a good time and a good time to garner gifts.

## Gathering Gifts

Since its a good time to garner gifts, the players all go around town to see what they can get before they Set Off. When Players are on a mission they're allowed to do one major action like this. Its usually defined by needing to make a roll to see if it succeeds.

### Flora's Armor

Flora doesn't feel safe with just her travel clothes. Her Clavat ability lets her defend her friends. She intends to make the most of it. She goes to Tipa's blacksmith and explains her worries to them. Flora's player is told to make a Unity roll.

The GM thinks of the possible outcomes and keeps them secret.

If she succeeds, she'll be given a gift of armor.
If she fails, they'll offer to turn their Makeshift Shield into a Bronze Shield if they can find the material.
If she rolls a crit or more than one hit, they might shower her with some other gifts too.

Flora is a Clavat so she rolls an extra dice when rolling Unity. Her Travel Clothes also give her an extra Unity dice. Which means she rolls 5d6 on this action.

She rolls a pool of 2, 1, 4, 6, 1. 2, 1, and 1 are below her Unity stat of 3. She gets 3 hits.

She's gifted the armor. Its simple **Bronze Plate**, which gives her some extra hearts. The GM wants to do something with that extra success so he asks Flora's player to choose between "Do you want it to be pretty, or do you want to learn something?"

If she chooses for it to be pretty, then the armor also looks like Travel Clothes, granting it the bonus unity dice effect in town. This is an ad hoc mechanic that the GM decided should be easy to work around. Travel Clothes only provide their benefits in towns, and players always have the option to change into them anyway.

If she wants to learn something, the blacksmith shares a story with her about something called the Gaia Plate. A powerful armor powered by a Clavat's sense of unity. They offer her some plans for it - a collection of research and instructions.

She elects for the armor to be pretty. Her family gave her these travel clothes, and upgrading them into armor sounds like a great way to keep them in her thoughts. The GM agrees and moves onto the next player's actions.
