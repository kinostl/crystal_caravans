# The Town of Tipa

You and your party come from the town of Tipa, on the Tipa Peninsula.

<!-- TODO this needs to be an actual introduction. It should define buy-ins, give an overview of the first year, and an overview of what dungeons are available during it. It should also tell players about what their charaters should know such as what towns are nearby. -->
