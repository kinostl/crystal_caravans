# Missions

Missions are actually a collection of encounters, a gimmick, and a guardian.

They also come with a theme, and a list of details for the party to learn about in nearby towns.

These details might be the monsters inside, the guardian, the history, or things that need doing there in addition to the mission.

## Monster Blocks

Monsters are detailed in this way. Everything after the vulnerability line are special abilities of the monster.

<div class="monster-list" markdown>
**Goblin Chieftan** 24 Hearts  
Combat 2, Unity 2, Magic 1  
_Resistant to_ -  
_Vulnerable to_ Fire  
Provides other Goblins an extra dice on all rolls.  
Unity: Other Goblins get +1 to their stats this turn.
</div>

### Passive Skills

Some skills in a monster block do not require a roll. For example, the Chieftan's ability to make other Goblins stronger.

!!! example "Goblin Chieftan's Passive Ability"

    Provides other Goblins an extra dice on all rolls.

These skills effect the scene. They no longer effect the narrative when the monster leaves the scene unless otherwise stated.

### Rolling Skills

Some monsters have skills that you need to roll to activate, the Goblin Chieftan for example has this skill:

!!! example "Goblin Chieftan's Unity Ability"

    Unity: Other Goblins get +1 to their stats this turn.

When you want to use this skill, the monster makes that its action for the turn. Roll the stat listed before the colon like normal. If any of them succeed, the effect after the colon occurs.

So to use this one, you'd have the Goblin Chieftan roll Unity to give other goblins +1 to their stats this turn.

## Area Blocks

!!! example "An Area Block"

    **Entrance**

    Description of the entrance to the path

    ***Exits***

    -   Drawbridge (Locked Shortcut)
    -   Goblin Gate

The Entrance is the name of the area.

The Exits section list what other Areas this Area leads to.

`(Locked Shortcut)` is a note about the exit. Sometimes you can tell from a distance.

!!! note "Reminder - Safe Areas"

    When the Area is safe from monsters and traps, the game master will secretly roll 1d6 to determine what kind of area is behind each exit.

    You may attempt to garner information about what lies ahead.

## Guardians

Guardians are like monsters, but they have some changes. They're capable of crits, they have more hearts, and they can take a number of actions equal to the number of players.
