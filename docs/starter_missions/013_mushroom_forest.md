# Mushroom Forest

> When I was a child, I once asked my mother, "Where did I come from?"

> She answered, "Why, we all sprouted from the Mushroom Forest, of course."

> I awoke in tears, but felt the warmth of my mother's embrace as she comforted me. It is something I still remember to this day.

## Defeat Malboro

A fearsome bundle of teeth and vines sits in front of the Myrrh Tree. It does not protect it. It seeks victims. Its roots threaten to perish the Myrrh Tree. The Miasma in this place is thicker than it should be. The Mushrooms of this forest glow with an uncomfortable yellow and green. You might become lost amongst the toadstools here, just like that dream.

**Malboro**{.boss-name} 20 Hearts  
Combat 2, Unity 0, Magic 3  
_Resistant to_ Slow, Stop  
_Vulnerable to_ Fire

Malboro's Hell Plants have the Vine Bind and Summon Miasma ability.

Malboro can only use Aurum Vale when there are less Hell Plants than its Combat stat.

Excess Damage done to Hell Plants is redirected to the Malboro.

_Bad Breath_ --- Magic: For each hit, a target is poisoned.  
_Aurum Vale_ --- Combat: For each hit summon a Hell Plant.  
_Vine Bind_ --- When an attack crits, paralyze the target.  
_Tentacle Bind_ --- When an attack crits a paralyzed target, also freeze them.  
_Summon Miasma_ --- At the end of each turn roll 1d6. If its odd, thicken the miasma by 1.
