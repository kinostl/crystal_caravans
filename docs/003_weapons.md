Things you hit stuff with

## Focus Attacks

Weapons have "Focus Attacks". When you roll a crit you activate your Focus Attack. Focus attacks can damage multiple targets, cause status effects, and all kinds of effects.

A Focus Attack's Status Effect lasts a number of turns equal to the number of crits that activated it.
