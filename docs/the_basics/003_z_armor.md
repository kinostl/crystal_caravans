# Armor

Anyone can use armor. It protects you from status effects and gives you extra hearts. Except for Travel Clothes, which give you an extra dice when rolling Unity in town instead. People are more comfortable around clothes than armor.

All tribes start with **Travel Clothes**.

## Armor Accessories

Every Tribe has their own signature Armor Accessory. Clavats have Shields. Lilties have Gloves. Yukes have Helmets, and Selkies have Sashes.
