# Fusion

!!! Tip inline end "Off Book Fusions"

    You're allowed to go off book. If you want to summon steam by combining Fire and Ice, go ahead. The GM will tell you how that'll work out. Feel free to suggest something.

You can fuse the spell summoned by magicite with other summons, or with attacks if it is an attacking spell.

Summoning it in conjunction with...

...an attack will cause the attack to take on that spell, and guarantee its status effect for a turn.

...another summon of a different spell will cause the two summons to fuse into a new spell.

...another summon of the same spell will cause the summon to be more powerful.

When you fuse a spell, add up the successes of everyone contributing a spell.

Crits on a spell fusion cause the status effect to occur for a number of turns equal to the number of crits.

Crits on an attack fusion add additional turns to the status effect.

!!! Question inline end "About Holy and Stop"

    Holy and Stop use the same components. Choose one or the other when doing the fusion summon. In the video-game this choice was decided via timing.

## Attacking Spell Fusions

-   **Gravity** Fusion of different attacking spells. Summons gravity. Causes stasis.
-   **Holy** Fusion of attacking and healing spells. Summons holy energy. Causes no status effect.

!!! Info inline end "Holy's Status Effect"

    Being made of Miasma, all monsters are vulnerable to Holy unless stated otherwise. This takes the place of its Status Effect.

## Healing Spell Fusions

These count as Status Effects.

-   **Haste** Fusion of two healing spells. Target takes two actions on their turn. Effect lasts a number of turns equal to the number of successes.
-   **Stop** Fusion of healing and attacking spells. Target cannot take actions on their turn. Effect lasts a number of turns equal to the number of successes.

## Weapon Fusions

You can fuse any one attacking Magicite to a weapon. Weapons with an elemental affinity roll 1 extra dice when attacking enemies vulnerable to that element.

-   **Firestrike** Fuse with Fire. Attacks have a fire affinity.
    -   _Focus Attack_ For every crit burn the target.
-   **Blizardstrike** Fuse with Blizzard. Attacks have an ice affinity.
    -   _Focus Attack_ For every crit freeze the target.
-   **Thunderstrike** Fuse with Thunder. Attacks have a lightning affinity.
    -   _Focus Attack_ For every crit paralyze the target.

### Fusion Weapon Fusions

Caused by finding a way to fuse two magicite to a weapon, or from fusing with a spell or attacking the same target as another fused weapon.

-   **Gravitystrike** Fusion of attacking spells. Attacks have a gravity affinity.
    -   _Focus Attack_ For every crit put the target in stasis.
-   **Holystrike** Fusion of attacking spells and healing spells. Attacks have a holy affinity.
    -   _Focus Attack_ For every crit clear a status effect from yourself or the target.
