# Dungeon Delving

You start a dungeon fresh. Your hearts are full, your stomachs are fed, and you're ready to take on anything. Go deep and get that dew.

<!--TODO Talk about how the Miasma is thicker in dungeons and how that limits you to a small space and how that works mechanically. Such as the lack of range mechanics. -->

## Fighting Monsters

<!-- TODO Redirecting Damage Mechanics. Actions shouldn't be wasted and whiffed. -->

Fighting is a back and forth between the party and a band of monsters. The party says every action they plan on taking to win the fight, then roll the relevant dice (Usually Combat or Magic).

Players always get the first action unless the miasma has reached the level where monsters are no longer surprised. At that point they know you're there and start combats.

_Every_ dice that is a success contributes to this roll. For every success, choose a monster. It loses a heart. They'll do the same to you, until one side has lost.

When the party runs out of hearts, they tuck their tail between their legs and run back to town to heal.

When a monster runs out of hearts it turns back into miasma.

### Crits

Crits on attacks count as 2 successes instead of 1.

## Solving Traps and Puzzles

Monsters can't be everywhere, so they'll set up traps to harm the curious adventurer, and they'll hide their pathways behind puzzles and secrets. When you enter a node with no monsters, its safe to assume its a puzzle or a trap. The Game Master will let you know if its a set piece or if it holds a harmless secret to discover.

Traps and Puzzles are interchangeable, they both require your focus to solve. When you encounter one the GM wil inform you what kind it is, and what needs to be accomplished to solve it. Failing a roll while solving a puzzle thickens the miasma.

## Exploring

Some places are just beautiful detours. If you find yourself in an Exploration tile the GM will tell you something about the world or the dungeon, then let you know that everyone can take one action without thickening the miasma. This is a good time to eat food, heal with magicite, and manage your inventory.

### Moogle Nest

Moogles live in Moogle Nests, and they love visitors. They might give you some free items, a meal, or another opportunity to take actions without thickening the fog.

Your moogle companion will let you know about nearby Moogle Nests if they're in a good mood.

### Thin the Miasma

You can roll Unity while exploring to thin the Miasma. Reduce it by 1 or each success.

### Calm Healing Bonus

If you have a Healing Magicite and use it on an Exploration node, roll Unity in addition to the usual Magic roll. Add those successes to your magic successes.

## Fighting the Guardian

The final node in every mission is a Guardian of the Myrrh Tree. This might be something the Myrrh Tree placed there. It might be something the Miasma put there. A fight with a guardian is the same as a fight with a band of monsters. A Guardian is one entity with a large hp pool, powerful attacks, and the abilities that allow them to act multiple times. Usually once per charater fighting it. This might be creating minions, using time magic, or many other things.

When you defeat the Guardian, you've finished the mission.

## Finishing a Mission

The end of the mission grants you a drop of Myrrh dew, treasure, and time to rest.

### Myrrh dew drop

Your chalice gains a drop of dew. When you collect three, you've collected enough for your town to survive another year. It takes two years for a tree to form a dew drop, so its traditional to only take what you need.

### Treasure

Myrrh trees are known to collect the remains of failed attempts to get past a tree's guardian. Nowadays it is better known as Treasure.

A pool of treasure starts with 1 piece of treasure for each player. Every risky roll a player has taken during the mission adds another piece of treasure to the pool.

The party distributes treasure as they see fit, but its polite to give players that have risked the most first choice.

#### Sellable Items

Myrrh trees also hold items of high value that are easy to transport, like rare ingredients and materials.

### Relaxing

The presence around a Myrrh tree is absolutely safe from monsters, beautiful, and serene. It heals the soul and body.

You've just finished a dangerous mission. Stay a while, and appreciate this place.

Heal your wounds, write some letters to your family, and fill out your diary.
