<!-- TODO fill out beastiary -->
<!-- Lancer's limited Monster pool might be a good idea here. Then add "Recoloring" rules for making them stronger. -->
<!-- Player characters have 12 or 18 health, and the most damage you can individually do is probably 3. Fights shouldn't run long, so most monsters should have 1 2 or 3 hearts. -->
<!-- Fighting encounters should probably have a total of enemy hearts equal to the number of players. -->
<!-- Guardians can have more, maybe 12 or 18, to put them on the same heart count as a PC. That would require everyone rolling 3 hits and focusing entirely on attacking.-->
