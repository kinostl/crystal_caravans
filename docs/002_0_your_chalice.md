# You and Your Chalice

Miasma is pushed back by the purity of myrrh channeled by crystals. Your home town of Tipa, like all towns, is protected by a large crystal. You carry a piece of it with you, in a receptical known as the chalice.

The chalice holds the myrrh dew drops you seek to bring back home. It produces a node sized zone that wards off the miasma and its poisonous effects. Monsters can still enter a warded space.

## Chalice Carrier

Your party is friends with a Moogle. A fluffy flying creature that's immune to the miasma. Decide as a group what they're like by choosing one trait from this list.

They're happy to carry the chalice for you.

- **Strong** +1 Chalice Accessory Slot
- **Brave** Willing to act alone
- **Magical** Treat your Chalice as a Magicite

Don't forget to name them. Moogle names traditionally fit "Mog" into them somehow.

## Chalice Accessories

Some treasures are Chalice Accessories. They provide effects that apply to everyone under the Chalice's protective ward.

A Chalice has 1 Accessory Slot for every member of the party.

## Chalice Element

When you visit a Myrrh tree, it will have an Element. You may choose to change your Chalice's element to the Myrrh tree's element.

If the Chalice Carrier is magical, you can treat the Chalice as a magicite of the same element.

A Chalice also wards off mana of its current element. Roll an extra dice when fighting Monsters of the Chalice's element. You may pass through Mana Streams of the matching element.

The elements a chalice can attune to are Fire, Water, Wind, and Earth.

- Fire becomes Fire Magicite
- Water becomes Ice Magicite
- Wind becomes Thunder Magicite
- Earth becomes Clear Magicite
