## Prologue

> Seek the water of life.
>
> Long ago, miasma swallowed the world. Its very touch was fatal, and it claimed many lives. But we have since discovered a way to hold it at bay.
>
> Crystals protect us from miasma. Smaller crystals now guard the villages of the world, while greater ones guard the cities. We all live our lives within the embrace of the crystals' blessing.
>
> The power of the crystals is not limitless, however; it gradually diminishes over time. We must rekindle the crystals' radiance each year by purifying them with myrrh. In turn, they protect us from the miasma for another year.
>
> But myrrh cannot be found just anywhere. We must seek it in the dank depths of dungeons, across forbidding mountains, even beyond the sea.
>
> This task falls to groups of youth sent off each year by every town the world over. It is their duty to collect myrrh and bring it home. They are known as the crystal caravans.
>
> This is the tale of one such caravan and its adventures.

## Making your character

You and your party come from the town of Tipa, on the Tipa Peninsula.

### Attributes

You have these Attributes. Distribute 2,2, and 3 across Combat, Magic, and Unity. Higher is better. Luck starts at 1.

- **Combat** Swinging weapons, knowing things about combat.
- **Magic** Casting spells with Magicite, knowing things about magic.
- **Unity** Getting to know people, resolving conflicts among friends.
- **Luck** For everything else.

Your backstory will give you additional dice for certain stats and/or actions. You'll be rolling these stats for attacking, defending, casting magic, and interacting with the world.

#### Calculate Hearts

Hearts determine how much damage you can take. Your tribe gives you hearts. If you are a...

- **Clavat** you have 6 Hearts for every point of Unity.
- **Liltie** you have 6 Hearts for every point of Combat.
- **Yuke**   you have 6 Hearts for every point of Magic.
- **Selkie** you have 6 Hearts for every point of Luck.

You have an additional 6 **Hearts** for every point of **Combat** you have.
<!-- TODO Verify 6 is a good number to work off of. -->
<!-- This is because 6 is the highest number on a d6 -->

### Who you can be

You can choose from four tribes. Some equipment is tribe specific.

Your tribe comes with all listed benefits.

#### The Clavats

!!! Info inline end "Clavat Benefits"
    - 1 Extra Dice when rolling Unity
    - Redirect damage to yourself, up to your Unity stat.

A gentle people that value harmony above all.

Many of Tipa's residents belong to this tribe of unity and friendship. They are gentle by nature and dislike conflict. When disputes arise, they do whatever they can to resolve them. It is said that an air of tranquility follows them wherever they go.


#### The Lilties

!!! Info inline end "Liltie Benefits"
    - 1 Extra Dice when rolling Combat
    - Better Weapons. More Hearts.

A proud warrior tribe with infamously short tempers.

These little warriors have lived all over the world since ancient times. Long ago, they ruled the world, and many still believe themselves superior to others. Though they can be hotheaded, they are also confident and down-to-earth. Liltian merchants are some of the best around.


#### The Yukes

!!! Info inline end "Yuke Benefits"
    - 1 Extra Dice when rolling Magic
    - Start dungeons with a random magicite

A mysterious tribe of great lore and wisdom.

Many of these sages live quietly in Shella. In the ancient wars, they were able to resist the invading Liltian armies thanks to their magical prowess. Now they spend their days teaching magic to others. Some say that Yukes assumed their current form to augment their magical talents. They are a mysterious people indeed.


#### The Selkies

!!! Info inline end "Selkie Benefits"
    - 1 Extra Dice when rolling Luck
    - Rolling a 1 also counts as a crit
    - Ignore the first Underclock roll on each node

Independent people who put themselves first.

These rugged individualists clothe themselves in fur decorated with stolen goods. Unlike other tribes, they believe in putting themselves first. Many Selkies are agile and athletic, traits they put to good use as thieves. Though the other tribes tend to scorn them, some Selkies now reside in Clavatian villages.

### Favorite Food

Eating your Favorite Food heals one additional heart. Choose from Meat, Fish, Striped Apple, Cherry Cluster, Star Carrot, and Round Corn.

Look at the end of this document to learn what the foods do in addition to healing.

### Your Family Trade

Your Family has a trade. Choose one that hasn't been chosen from Blacksmith, Tailor, Farmer, Rancher, Miller, Fisherman, Merchant, and Alchemist. This will effect what kind of gifts you get from sending mail to your family.

## How to Do Stuff

When you do something that has a risk to it, roll 3d6. Every dice resulting in a value less than or equal to the appropriate stat is a success. Dice that are equal to the appropriate stat exactly are Crits.

During a mission you may choose to roll 2d6 instead of 3d6. If you choose to do this you gain an additional treasure at the end of the mission regardless of the result.

## Leveling up

In most tabletop games you are able to level up. This system does not have the concept of levels. Instead you will be provided abilites, treasures, and artifacts that all modify your attributes.

### Reallocating Stats

During extensive downtime you can reallocate your attributes, setting the 2,2, and 3 as you did during character generation. You should have enough down time to flavor this appropriately if you elect to do this. Going to a school, working with a trainer, etc. The 3 represents your focus and specialization.

## Going through a Mission

Your mission has one goal: Get a drop of dew from a Myrrh tree in the depths of places where no one dare go. Dungeons and forests and forgotten places filled with monsters and their conniving traps.

The Miasma is a living thing that does not want you to do this. It is threatened by Myrrh. It cannot get close to a Myrrh tree to destory it, so it sets up defenses around it in the form of Monsters. They can enter warded places that Miasma can't, and they can harm in ways it cannot. Just like the Miasma, they want you dead. These defenses where Miasma and Myrrh conflict are known as Dungeons.

A Dungeon is made up of Nodes. Encounters that are either fighting, exploring, or puzzle solving. You won't know what a node is before entering it, but you will know the layout of a dungeon if you've been there before or if there are well made maps of it. Nodes change their type every time you enter the dungeon.

When you finish a node, the GM will secretly roll 1d6 for each exit to see what kind of node it leads to. This is so you can try to get hints about whats in each node before approaching it. Asking for hints acts the same as a Puzzle node.

1. Fight
2. Explore
3. Trap
4. Fight w/ Treasure
5. Explore w/ Mog Cave
6. Trap w/ Treasure

### Underclock

Dungeons have something called the ["Underclock"](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2023/04/the-underclock-fixing-random-encounter.html).

The underclock starts at 0. When you advance the underclock, add 1d6 to the Underclock.

When the underclock is above...

- 6, monsters will no longer be surprised by you.
- 12, the party becomes and stays nausesous.
- 18, the party becomes poisoned and loses 1 heart every time they roll.
- 24, consider the mission faied. Abandon the dungeon and return to town.

Rename consideration: Increase the Fog? Thicken the Miasma?

#### What makes it tick?

This list is not exhaustive

- Some monsters may roll to advance the clock instead of attaking.
- Taking too many actions while exploring or solving puzzles advances the clock.

<!-- TODO Implement Goblin Punch's Underclock idea. -->
<!-- https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2023/04/the-underclock-fixing-random-encounter.html -->

### Fighting Monsters

Fighting is a back and forth between the party and a band of monsters. The party says every action they plan on taking to win the fight, then roll the relevant dice (Usually Combat or Magic).

*Every* dice that is a success contributes to this roll. For every success, choose a monster. It loses a heart. They'll do the same to you, until one side has lost.

When the party runs out of hearts, they tuck their tail between their legs and run back to town to heal.

When a monster runs out of hearts it turns back into miasma.

#### Crits

Crits on attacks count as 2 successes instead of 1.

### Solving Traps and Puzzles

Monsters can't be everywhere, so they'll set up traps to harm the curious adventurer, and they'll hide their pathways behind puzzles and secrets. When you enter a node with no monsters, its safe to assume its a puzzle or a trap. The Game Master will let you know if its a set piece or if it holds a harmless secret to discover.

Traps and Puzzles are interchangeable, they both require your focus to solve. When you encounter one the GM wil inform you what kind it is, and what needs to be accomplished to solve it. Failing a roll while solving a puzzle advances the underclock.

### Exploring

Some places are just beautiful detours. If you find yourself in an Exploration tile the GM will tell you something about the world or the dungeon, then let you know that everyone can take one action without advancing the underclock. This is a good time to eat food, heal with magicite, and manage your inventory.

#### Mog Hole

Some of these detours have whats known as a Mog Hole. Your moogle companion will let you know about that if they're in a good mood. Moogles live in Mog Holes, and they love visitors. They might give you some free items, a meal, or another opportunity to take actions without advancing the underclock.

#### Wind back the undercock

You can roll Unity while exploring to wind back the Underclock. Reduce it by 1 or each success.

#### Calm Healing Bonus

If you have a Healing Magicite and use it on an Exploration node, roll Unity in addition to the usual Magic roll. Add those successes to your magic successes.

### Fighting the Guardian

The final node in every mission is a Guardian of the Myrrh Tree. This might be something the Myrrh Tree placed there. It might be something the Miasma put there. A fight with a guardian is the same as a fight with a band of monsters. A Guardian is one entity with a large hp pool, powerful attacks, and the abilities that alow them to act multiple times. Usually once per charater fighting it. This might be creating minions, using time magic, or many other things.

When you defeat the Guardian, you've finished the mission.

### Finishing a Mission

The end of the mission grants you a drop of Myrrh dew, treasure, and time to rest.

#### Myrrh dew drop

Your chalice gains a drop of dew. When you collect three, you've collected enough for your town to survive another year. It takes two years for a tree to form a dew drop, so its traditional to only take what you need.

#### Treasure

Myrrh trees are known to collect the remains of failed attempts to get past a tree's guardian. Nowadays it is better known as Treasure. A pool of treasure starts with 1 piece of treasure for each player. Every risky roll a player has taken during the mission adds another piece of treasure to the pool. The party distributes it as they see fit.

##### Sellable Items

Myrrh trees also hold items of high value that are easy to transport, like rare ingredients and materials.

#### Relaxing

The presence around a Myrrh tree is absolutely safe from monsters, beautiful, and serene. It heals the soul and body. You've just finished a dangerous mission. Stay a while, and appreciate this place. Heal your wounds, write some letters to your family, and fill out your diary.

## Focus Attacks

Weapons have "Focus Attacks". When you roll a crit you activate your Focus Attack. Focus attacks can damage multiple targets, cause status effects, and all kinds of effects.

A Focus Attack's Status Effect lasts a number of turns equal to the number of crits that activated it.

### Clavat

- **Power Slash** For every crit, deal a point of damage to the target.
- **Piercing Sweep** For every crit, deal a point of damage to another target.
- **Bash**
- **Shadowblade**
- **Soulshot**

### Lilties

- **Cyclone Slash** For every crit, another target is also attacked.
- **Psi Blast** For every crit, a target can not use magic.
- **Bladestorm**
- **Cross Slash**
- **Pulse Thrust**
- **Avalanche**

### Yuke

- **Power Bomb** For every crit, burn a target.
- **Wave Bomb** For every crit, freeze a target.
- **Shock Bomb** For every crit, paralyze a target.
- **Magic Bomb** For every crit burn another target. Repeat this for freeze and paralyze.

### Selkie

- **Aura Blast**
- **Stampede** For every crit, deal a point of damage to a target.
- **Dual Blast** For every crit, attack the target again. Ignore crits on those attacks.
- **Power Kick** For every crit, stop the target and deal a point of damage to it.
- **Meteor Strike** For every crit, attack the target again.
    - *(Crits on these attacks activate Meteor Strike again)*

## Magicite

The spaces where a myrrh tree and miasma collide contain "Magicite". Miasma contained in a bubble of myrrh dew.

You'll find them sometimes while you explore, win fights, and solve puzzles.

You can use these to cast spells. Focus on a target, and roll magic. When you do this, you'll summon the magicite's spell on your target.

Magicite turns back into miasma when it leaves the space between a myrrh tree and miasma.


### Attacking Spells

Attacking Spells are common and hearty. Use them with abandon.

Casting an attacking spell on a target causes it to take damage like a normal attack.

- **Fire** Summons Fire. Causes burning .
- **Blizzard** Summons Ice. Causes freezing .
- **Thunder** Summons Lightning. Causes paralysis .

If an enemy is vulnerable to a spell, roll an extra dice.

If an enemy is resistant to a spell, roll one less dice.

Crits cause a status effect. Status effects last a number of turns equal to the number of crits.

### Healing Spells

Healing Spells are rare and fragile. Use them with caution.

Healing spell magicite breaks on a failure, after casting the spell.

- **Cure** Heals one heart for the target. Heals an additional heart for each sucess.
- **Clear** Removes status effects from the target. Clear an additional target for each success.
- **Life** Revives a fallen party member. Revive an additional target for each success.

## Fusion

!!! Tip inline end "Off Book Fusions"
    You're allowed to go off book. If you want to summon steam by combining Fire and Ice, go ahead. The GM will tell you how that'll work out. Feel free to suggest something.

You can fuse the spell summoned by magicite with other summons, or with attacks if it is an attacking spell.

Summoning it in conjunction with...

...an attack will cause the attack to take on that spell, and guarantee its status effect for a turn.

...another summon of a different spell will cause the two summons to fuse into a new spell.

...another summon of the same spell will cause the summon to be more powerful.

When you fuse a spell, add up the successes of everyone contributing a spell.

Crits on a spell fusion cause the status effect to occur for a number of turns equal to the number of crits.

Crits on an attack fusion add additional turns to the status effect.


!!! Question inline end "About Holy and Stop"
    Holy and Stop use the same components. Choose one or the other when doing the fusion summon. In the video-game this choice was decided via timing.

### Attacking Spell Fusions

- **Gravity** Fusion of different attacking spells. Summons gravity. Causes stasis.
- **Holy** Fusion of attacking and healing spells. Summons holy energy. Causes no status effect.

!!! Info inline end "Holy's Status Effect"
    Being made of Miasma, most monsters are vulnerable to Holy. This takes the place of its Status Effect.

### Healing Spell Fusions

These count as Status Effects.

- **Haste** Fusion of two healing spells. Target takes two actions on their turn. Effect lasts a number of turns equal to the number of successes.
- **Stop** Fusion of healing and attacking spells. Target cannot take actions on their turn. Effect lasts a number of turns equal to the number of successes.

### Weapon Fusions

You can fuse any attacking Magicite to a weapon.

- **Firestrike** Fuse with Fire. Attacks have a fire affinity.
    - *Focus Attack* For every crit burn the target.
- **Blizardstrike** Fuse with Blizzard. Attacks have an ice affinity.
    - *Focus Attack* For every crit freeze the target.
- **Thunderstrike** Fuse with Thunder. Attacks have a lightning affinity.
    - *Focus Attack* For every crit paralyze the target.

#### Fusion Weapon Fusions

Caused by finding a way to fuse two magicite to a weapon, or from fusing with a spell or attacking alongside another fused weapon.

- **Gravitystrike** Fusion of attacking spells. Attacks have a gravity affinity.
    - *Focus Attack* For every crit put the target in stasis.
- **Holystrike** Fusion of attacking spells and healing spells. Attacks have a holy affinity.
    - *Focus Attack* For every crit clear a status effect from yourself or the target.

## Status Effects

- **Burning** Lose 1 Heart when you roll
- **Paralyzed** +1 to all dice
- **Frozen** Roll 1 less dice
- **Stasis** Only crits succeed
- **Nausesous** Food only heals HP

## You and Your Chalice

Miasma is pushed back by the purity of myrrh channeled by crystals. Your home town of Tipa, like all towns, is protected by a large crystal. You carry a piece of it with you, in a receptical known as the chalice.

The chalice holds the myrrh dew drops you seek to bring back home. It produces a node sized zone that wards off the miasma and its poisonous effects. Monsters can still enter a warded space.

### Chalice Carrier

Your party is friends with a Moogle. A fluffy flying creature that's immune to the miasma. Decide as a group what they're like by choosing one trait from this list.

They're happy to carry the chalice for you.

- **Strong** +1 Chalice Accessory Slot
- **Brave** Willing to act alone
- **Magical** Treat your Chalice as a Magicite

Don't forget to name them. Moogle names traditionally fit "Mog" into them somehow.

### Chalice Accessories

Some treasures are Chalice Accessories. They provide effects that apply to everyone under the Chalice's protective ward.

A Chalice has 1 Accessory Slot for every member of the party.

### Chalice Element

When you visit a Myrrh tree, it will have an Element. You may choose to change your Chalice's element to the Myrrh tree's element.

If the Chalice Carrier is magical, you can treat the Chalice as a magicite of the same element.

A Chalice also wards off mana of its current element. Roll an extra dice when fighting Monsters of the Chalice's element.

## Travel

The world is made up of destinations connected by trails. To go to a destination, it must have a trail to it. Your caravan cannot travel without a trail. Trails were created by adventurers before you under the protection of a crystal chalice as they flattened the ground for caravans.

### Leaving the trail

If you leave the trail, abandon your caravan and treat it as if you were exploring a dungeon.

### Other Crystal Caravans

You are not the only crystal caravan out there. You'll find other caravans on their own travels. Seeking myrrh dews just like you. Trading resources between towns. Exploring the word. Many caravans are friendly. They'll offer to trade with you, share knowledge, or involve you in their story. You'll meet them when you're on the trails between destinations.

## Towns

You'll find yourself stopping at friendly towns often. They offer you a chance to rest, learn about the world, and meet new people under the protection of a crystal.

### Shopping

Towns will very often have one or two stores selling supplies, armor, or weapons. Some might even sell powerful Accessories that can grant you magic or abilities. The GM will tell you the costs of what they have to sell, but its safe to assume that common things are cheap, uncommon things are a little pricey, and rare things are expensive.

Recommended prices for items and their rarity are listed at the end of this document.

If you're looking to find something rare, you may roll Unity to see if anyone knows where you can find it in town. On a crit or multiple successes the seller will be friendly and might give you discounts or alternative costs.

### Letters from the Family

When you rest in town, the mogmail service will bring you letters from your family. They'll send gifts to you. Excess from the year's harvest or something crafted from materials you've sent them.

The first time you visit a town after finishing a mission without receiving mail, you'll receive mail. When you receive this mail roll Unity. For every success you'll receive a gift. Crits will be rare gifts. For every gift you've sent them you may reroll a dice.

You can send mail when you're in town at any mogmail moogle.

### Learning about Missions

Towns are always one node away from a dungeon. People living in town learn a lot about nearby dungeons from their own exploration, and from talking to the adventurers that pass through. They're happy to share that knowledge if you ask them about it. Say what you're researching, and roll Unity to go around town asking about happenings. The GM will tell you a fact for each dice rolled. A number of them are guaranteed to be true, equal to the amount of success you've rolled.

Sometimes they might ask you favors if you're going there. If you do, they'll usually have a good reward to give you if you do. It might be finding a rare ingredient for them while you're there, or maybe getting revenge on a specific monster. Everyone has different favors they need doing.

## Equipment

Your character has 4 Equipment Slots - Weapon, Armor, and two Accessory Slots. Trying to wear or carry more than this will overwhelm your character.

You may put Food into your accessory slots. Eating it will free up the accessory slot.

Magicite that isn't fused to a weapon takes up an accessory slot.

## Time Mechanics

I want to do something with the idea of there being 4 seasons per year, with the season changing after each mission, and the year ending after 4 seasons.

## Monsters

THIS WILL BE A TABLE
<!-- TODO fill out beastiary -->
<!-- Lancer's limited Monster pool might be a good idea here. Then add "Recoloring" rules for making them stronger. -->
<!-- Player characters have 12 or 18 health, and the most damage you can individually do is probably 3. Fights shouldn't run long, so most monsters should have 1 2 or 3 hearts. -->
<!-- Fighting encounters should probably have a total of enemy hearts equal to the number of players. -->
<!-- Guardians can have more, maybe 12 or 18, to put them on the same heart count as a PC. That would require everyone rolling 3 hits and focusing entirely on attacking.-->

## Food

Food effects end if you exit the dungeon, become nausesous, or eat a new piece of food.

Eat food at the start of a Mission or while relaxing in the middle of a mission.

Food you eat at your caravan does not count as food brought into the dungeon.

Eating food heals 1 heart in addition to the listed effect.

- **Meat** 1 extra dice when rolling Combat
- **Fish** 1 extra dice when rolling Combat
- **Striped Apple** 1 extra dice when rolling Magic
- **Cherry Cluster** 1 extra dice when rolling Magic
- **Star Carrot** 3 Extra Hearts equal to your Combat
- **Round Corn**  3 Extra Hearts equal to your Combat

<!-- TODO look into if +1 to the stat is better for food effect -->
