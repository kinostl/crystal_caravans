## Prologue

> Seek the water of life.
>
> Long ago, miasma swallowed the world. Its very touch was fatal, and it claimed many lives. But we have since discovered a way to hold it at bay.
>
> Crystals protect us from miasma. Smaller crystals now guard the villages of the world, while greater ones guard the cities. We all live our lives within the embrace of the crystals' blessing.
>
> The power of the crystals is not limitless, however; it gradually diminishes over time. We must rekindle the crystals' radiance each year by purifying them with myrrh. In turn, they protect us from the miasma for another year.
>
> But myrrh cannot be found just anywhere. We must seek it in the dank depths of dungeons, across forbidding mountains, even beyond the sea.
>
> This task falls to groups of youth sent off each year by every town the world over. It is their duty to collect myrrh and bring it home. They are known as the crystal caravans.
>
> This is the tale of one such caravan and its adventures.
