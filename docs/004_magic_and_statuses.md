# Magic, Magicite, and Status Effects

The spaces where a myrrh tree and miasma collide contain "Magicite". Miasma contained in a bubble of myrrh dew.

You'll find them sometimes while you explore, win fights, and solve puzzles.

Magicite turns back into miasma when it leaves the space between a myrrh tree and miasma.

## Casting Spells

You can use magicite to cast spells. Focus on a target, and roll magic. When you do this, you'll summon the magicite's spell on your target.
