# Towns

You'll find yourself stopping at friendly towns often. They offer you a chance to rest, learn about the world, and meet new people under the protection of a crystal.

## Shopping

Towns will very often have one or two stores selling supplies, armor, or weapons. Some might even sell powerful Accessories that can grant you magic or abilities. The GM will tell you the costs of what they have to sell, but its safe to assume that common things are cheap, uncommon things are a little pricey, and rare things are expensive.

Recommended prices for items and their rarity are listed at the end of this document.

If you're looking to find something rare, you may roll Unity to see if anyone knows where you can find it in town. On a crit or multiple successes the seller will be friendly and might give you discounts or alternative costs.

## Letters from the Family

When you rest in town, the mogmail service will bring you letters from your family. They'll send gifts to you. Excess from the year's harvest or something crafted from materials you've sent them.

The first time you visit a town after finishing a mission without receiving mail, you'll receive mail. When you receive this mail roll Unity. For every success you'll receive a gift. Crits will be rare gifts. For every gift you've sent them you may reroll a dice.

You can send mail when you're in town at any mogmail moogle.

## Learning about Missions

Towns are always one node away from a dungeon. People living in town learn a lot about nearby dungeons from their own exploration, and from talking to the adventurers that pass through. They're happy to share that knowledge if you ask them about it. Say what you're researching, and roll Unity to go around town asking about happenings. The GM will tell you a fact for each dice rolled. A number of them are guaranteed to be true, equal to the amount of success you've rolled.

Sometimes they might ask you favors if you're going there. If you do, they'll usually have a good reward to give you if you do. It might be finding a rare ingredient for them while you're there, or maybe getting revenge on a specific monster. Everyone has different favors they need doing.
